What is Payu?
=============


Etymology
=========

* *P*\ ython on v\ *AYU*

  Vayu was Raijin's predecessor and has passed away...

  ...but Payu lives on!


Motivation
==========

Long ago, we managed many, many jobscripts.

Many kinds of scripts:
   bash, tcsh, ksh, ...

Many different models:
   MOM, MITgcm, Q-GCM, ACCESS, ...

Juggling and sharing scripts was becoming a problem!


Prehistoric Payu
================

.. code::

   #!/usr/bin/env python
   import os
   from payu import gold

   def main():
       expt = gold(forcing='andrew')

       expt.setup()
       expt.run()
       expt.archive()
       if expt.counter < expt.max_counter:
           expt.resubmit()

   if __name__ == '__main__': main()


Setting up
==========

Designate a "control directory":

.. code:: bash

   payu init -m mom

This will initialise your "laboratory"


Your laboratory
===============

Laboratory path ($LAB)
   /short/$PROJECT/$USER/mom
